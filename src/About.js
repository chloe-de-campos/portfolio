                        My name is Chloe and I am a junior user interface designer based in Providence, RI. I have a passion for creating intuitive and appealing designs that enhance the user experience. My design style is influenced by accessibility, functionality, and a strong focus on user-centered design principles.

                        I'm currently in my third year of Computer Science at Brown University. I've gained valuable experience through internships at <a href="https://www.sasaki.com/">Sasaki</a> and the <a href="https://www.sustaininfrastructure.org/">Center for Sustainable Infrastructure</a>, and a term at the <a href="https://berlinartinstitute.com/">Berlin Art Institute</a>. I have a strong foundation in design principles and am proficient in design software such as Adobe Creative Suite and Figma.
